# Transformer networks for Neural Machine Translation

This is an implementation of the transformer for the paper

["Attention is all you need"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf)

It also contains the implementation of the Speech Transformer as in

["Very Deep Self-Attention Networks for End-to-End Speech Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13377)

----------------------------
Requirement: (mostly recommended to use with Anaconda3 - Python3.7)

PyTorch (1.0.1 or 1.1). The code base is normally kept up-to-date with the latest version of PyTorch.
